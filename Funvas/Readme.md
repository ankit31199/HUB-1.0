## ------------------FUNVAS---------------------------

This is a simple drawing window, made using HTML5 <canvas> element, CSS3, and JavaScript.It has a clean white background on which we can draw, write , paint or color anything we want
as per our needs. As its basic purpose is entertainment, it is named as Funvas instead of canvas. The Pen here is  multicolor and of different widths which changes accordingly as the
direction and speed  of the pen changes.
